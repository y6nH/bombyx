# Bombyx

This is a color scheme I like to use. It's dark and warm, with harmonious jewel-like highlights.

Since it reminded me of antique silk embroidery, I named it after the genus of the silk moth, _Bombyx mori_.

## Visual Studio Code

To install, make a new folder inside `~/.vscode/extensions/`, and copy in the file `vscode/themes/Bombyx.color-theme.json` from this project. Restart VSCode, and it should appear in your Color Theme list.

## Concfg for Windows command line

To get the Windows CMD and Powershell windows styled with Bombyx colors, install [Concfg](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg) and (using the file from the concfg folder in this project) run `concfg import Bombyx.json`.
